Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is a discipline that is concerned with systematic development of high quality software products by applying the engineering principles, methods, and tools.
Software Engineering helps in improving every aspect of the society by creating software applications and systems for communication, commerce, healthcare etc.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Programming language development like Fortran, C.
2. Establishment of the Software Engineering as a discipline in the 60s
3. Evolution of Structural Programming in the 70s
4. The popularity of Agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Gathering
Design
Implementation
Testing
Deployment
Maintenance

Requirement Gathering
The is the phase of collecting and documenting users need and system requirement.

Design
This is the phase of creating high-level and detailed design and user interface.

Implementation
This is the phase where development takes effect according to specification.

Testing
The phase of testing all aspect of system to ensure quality standards and functional requirements are met.

Deployment
The phase of distributing the software to the customer or users.

Maintenance
This is the phase after deployment for providing ongoing support, improvement and updates to the software product.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology adopts sequential approach with distinct phase while Agile methodology focuses on interactive and incremental approach.
Waterfall is often used where there is a high level of reliabilty needed for the project while Agile is used where one or more people or organizations interact with a system.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developers are responsible for writing code and implement software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer are resposible for executing the test plan to ensure high quality software product.
Project Manager are responsible for overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments are tools that helps speed up software development process. The include tools for writing, debugging, and testing the code. Examples are ItelliJIDEA, Eclipse
Version Control Systems are software tools used for tracking chnages to source code and for collaboration between team members. Examples are GIT, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing Requirement: This challenge can be overcome by using agile methods, defining the scope and quality criteria, implementing change control, and applying refactoring and testing
2. Tight Deadlines: This challenge can be overcome by defining the scope of the project, communicating effectively with stakeholders, team members and managers, work planning and prioritization.
3. Technical Debts: This challenge can be overcome by building a solid quality assurance process.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing: This is the testing of individual component or module of software.
2. Integration Testing: This is the testing of the interaction between different component of the software or subsystems.
3. System Testing:This is the testing of the entire software system as a whole.
4. Acceptance Testing: This is the testing of the software against the user requirements to ensure its satisfies the user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the process where you guide generative artificial intelligence by crafting questions or statements to get the desire response. 
Prompt engineering is important to ensure user obtain relevant results in their first prompt. It enhances the user-AI interaction. It helps mitigate bias in the large language models' training data.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: Write a story about the importance of stocktaking?
Improved Prompt: Write a story about the importance of stocktaking to a retail store owner whose store maintains large volume of inventory. Include the use of automated stocktaking solution in the story.
The improved prompt is more effective because it is more detail and specific.
